## Description

This project is a tech blog website for developers to chat about all things tech. It utilizes the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. Developers can create their own account with a username and password, then make posts under that account name as well as comment on other developers' posts.

To make comments or posts of your own, you'll be need to sign up or log in at one of the links in the navbar. Once logged in, you'll be redirected to your dashboard, where you can view, edit, and delete any of your posts, as well as create new posts. You'll also then be able to make comments when viewing other people's posts. To log out, you can click the logout button in the navbar.
